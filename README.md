## Methodology

1. **User Profile Creation**  
   Users input allergies, preferences, and health goals â€” stored securely in MongoDB.

2. **OCR-based Label Reading**  
   Users upload food label images â†’ Preprocessed with OpenCV â†’ Text extracted using Tesseract OCR.

3. **Allergen Detection via NLP**  
   SpaCy processes extracted text and matches it against a trained allergen database.

4. **Personalized Diet Recommendations**  
   Machine learning models generate customized plans considering calories, macros, allergies, and goals.

5. **Statistical Representation**  
   Matplotlib is used to visualize allergen exposure and nutritional trends.

6. **Feedback-Based Learning**  
   User feedback helps retrain models, improving accuracy and personalization.

## Result

- **80% accuracy** in detecting allergens from food labels  
- **90% success rate** in delivering personalized dietary recommendations  
- Reliable performance across varied food packaging and input quality
